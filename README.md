neopixel-strand-patterns
========================

Code dedicated to powering a strip of neopixel LED's in a turn signal scenario.

This code was developed for use with an Adfruit Gemma board.

The emergency functions should not be used (Under penalty of law) by non emergency personel and by doing so is a violation of the law and will most certainly get you arrested.
